# Task: Light Switch App with Vue

In this task we use the `v-on` directive to create a vue version of our [light switch app](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu/web-apps-foundation/blob/main/web-app-basics/01-light-switch.md) from the `web apps foundation` module.

## Fulfill the following tasks:

- [x] Try to refactor your existing (plain js and html) light switch with VueJS.
  - [x] If you didn't solve that issue before start from scratch!
